        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <div class="row animation" data-animation="fade-in-bottom">
            <p>
                In an age where so much of popular culture is shaped by online communities and landscapes, the question of how these
                digital cultures interact with other components of society arises. One such case of a digital culture is the “hyperpop”
                genre, whose popularity and influence exploded in a quarantine-induced virtual ecosystem. The genre consisting of
                intense electronic soundscapes rose to virality through algorithmic feeds and systems but ultimately reached and
                established an outwardly queer subculture. Hyperpop, aided by its roots and influences in queer culture along with its
                primarily digital presence, acts as a medium for queer artists and scenes to express and engage in their respective
                identities.

        <h1>Forming a genre: What is hyperpop and where did it come from?</h1>
        <div class="row animation" data-animation="fade-in-bottom">
            <p>
                Hyperpop is a term to describe what might be called a microgenre or somewhat of a music movement, popularized by a specific Spotify playlist of the same moniker. It provides an experimental and avant garde interpretation of common pop, infusing elements of various other genres, such as "electronic, hip hop and dance music".
            </p>

        <div class = "row animation" data-animation="fade-in-bottom">
            <p>
                Some of the notable early players that helped revolutionize and popularize the scene include <strong>Charli XCX</strong>, <strong>Sophie</strong>, <strong>AG Cook</strong>, and <strong>100 Gecs</strong>, who the Spotify playlist was a direct response to. These artists were largely associated with the PC Music collective, although as of now hyperpop encompasses many communities. It is important to note the largely queer identities of these early figures, which would be reflected in the fanbases and communities that formed around the genre.

                The genre's popularization through such a music streaming service is a key aspect of its current properties, as discussed in <i>The Mediation of Genre, Identity, and Difference in Contemporary (Popular) Music Streaming</i>. The algorithmic and humanistic curation of the genre is critical in understanding its queer readings. For instance, the authors describe the "non-binary artist Jodi" whose artist thumbnail visually encodes the genre in a gendered manner, "constructing a hyperfeminine softness associated with the hyperpop genre, which has centered trans and queer identities." Hyperpop, similar to some of the genres more thoroughly discussed in the work, has its properties constructed through the visual and categorical methodologies of Spotify.

        </div>
        <div class="row animation" data-animation="fade-in-bottom">
            <p>
                Furhtermore, because of its internet origins, its formation and documentation of such is uniquely situated, as is well discussed in <i>Assembling Hyperpop: Genre
                Formation on Wikipedia</i>, which exposes the tendency to associate and dissociate the genre from "non-musical identities
                (such as race, gender, and nationality)". The genre, by its own artists, is often described as genre-less, allowing
                artists to inhabit a "liminal space akin to the un-boxable, fluid significations of 'queer' emphasized by Judith
                Butler's definition of gender beyond a static binary." The authors of the paper contest that the loose definition of
                hyperpop is "not easily represented within Wikipedia's genre formation protocols", obscuring the genre's expression of queer culture through "camp lenses".

                To visualize the rise of the genre and its significance, we can observe Google Trends and Google NGrams charts of some keywords:

            <iframe name="ngram_chart"

        <div class="animation" data-animation="fade-in-bottom">
            <p>
                Firstly, the ngrams chart for solely hyperpop shows its minimal use in literature until recent years, where it even still composes a very small percentage of the total corpus. This may be due to a variety of reasons, such as the genre's youth, its internet origins, or its lack of mainstream appeal.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Google Trends chart for hyperpop shows a significant rise in interest around 2019, which is when the genre began to gain traction, while PC Music shows a similar rise in interest around 2014, when the collective was formed. Of course, hyperpop's popularity after 2019 (around when discord and COVID-19 also have spikes) rises much higher than PC Music and digicore, indicating its prevalence in popular usage.

            <p>
                Given the ongoing pandemic during the rise of hyperpop, community forming occured primarily through online mediums. According to the Dazed digital article, <i>Goodbye hyperpop: the rise and fall of the internet's most hated genre</i>, hyperpop music was "born on SoundCloud via Discord servers and Minecraft channels". Despite the physical separation, community was formed over the internet, with artists hosting raves in Minecraft or over Zoom, such as the now famous queer hyperpop rave, Subculture.

                <i>Opening Up Virtual Mosh Pits: Music Scenes and In-Game Concerts in Fortnite and Minecraft</i> describes the effect of these music-game environments on sociability and community forming.

                andthemusic traveled through a mixture of music genres like hardcore, eurodance,
                hip-hop, mainstream pop, and PC Music."

                Aside from the video game and online live music events, communities thriving over Discord and SoundClound formed a significant part of the hyperpop scene. In particular, the digicore scene was known for its tight-knit community and various collectives. One of the largest artists of the scene, Quinn, describes digicore as being "a lot dirtier, with unmastered soundscapes and distorted 808s that usually overtake the entire song."

                Nonbinary artist kuru describes the formation of the SoundCloud/Discord borne subgenre as a "shift towards describing
                artists and sounds that felt more homemade and raw and less professional and poppy", essentially a response to the
                commercialized label of hyperpop.

        <div class="animation" data-animation="fade-in-bottom">
            <p>
                Empowered by the connective abilities of the internet, a queer community formed through the hyperpop scene, but there is something innately queer or disruptive of heteronormative expectations about the genre's music. Driven by the founding figures of the genre, hyperpop has always maintained an element of self-expression in a largely queer fashion. For instance, in <i>Beyond the Binary: Digital Voices and Transhumanist Expression in Sophie’s Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides</i>, the author explores how the hyperfeminine and transhumanist expression of SOPHIE's music is a direct reflection of her trans identity. The digital components of hyperpop allow SOPHIE to express her queer identity, which can be seen in "Immaterial [which] represents an embrace of the hope of a futuristic, utopian formlessness" in both lyricism and musicality.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="animation" data-animation="fade-in-bottom">
            <p>
                Similarly, <i>The Alien Resonances and Queer Obscurities of Hyperpop’s 100 gecs</i> describes the aesthetic methodologies of the duo and their usage of hyperpop's "alien sonorities" to "transform the self through anonymous or opaque modes of production, receptivity, and transmission." In the case of 100 gecs, their debut album 1000 gecs is filled with queer relations and aesthetic appeals that present an otherworldly experience.

        <div class="animation" data-animation="fade-in-bottom">
            <p>
                Clearly, much of the literature regarding hyperpop's freedom of artistic self-expression and representing queer identities surrounds these early figures largely in the PC Music scene. However, these properties of the genre are also manifested in the more obscured digicore scene, where young trans artists such as Quinn and Jane Remover utilize what started as an online hobby to express their queer identities.

        <h1>Case Study: Jane Remover</h1>
        <div class="row animation" data-animation="fade-in-bottom">
            <p>
                Jane Remover is a transgender "producer, songwriter, and artist from New Jersey" whose early career took place in the SoundCloud and Discord digicore stage in 2019. Through both her first and debut albums (Teen Week and Frailty), Jane's groundbreaking music production and songwriting capabilities create emotional worlds that reflect her queer identity.

            <p>
                Her first EP, Teen Week, was somewhat of a sensation in the digicore scene, filled with intense production and themes of love, loss, and self-realization, as the title suggests. For instance, <i>woodside gardens 16 december 2012</i>, features a cyclical moment that evokes and almost spiraling feeling, where Jane recalls the heteronormative and transphobic standards she is subjected to.

                As an aside, when using the whisper audio model for this track and analyzing the resulting transcription using levenshtein distance, a word error rate of 72% is achieved. This is likely due to the heavy vocal effects and processing as well as intense production effects employed in most hyperpop tracks, which represents a potential gap in automated research capabilities for the genre.

                Jane's follow up album, Frailty, explores a playful yet atmospheric electronic soundscape while still incorporating her queer identity. A standout track, <i>movies for guys</i> utilizes this expansive sonic palette to illustrate a scene filled with references of the gender binary.
            </p>
            <p>
                The song's eerie themes of revenge against "an unaccepting environment" which caused Jane to "pretend to be

            </p>
            <p>
                Using the pydub silence detecter, the first silence in the track is at the beginning of the track (from around 0 to
                10s), where a sort of bit-crushed
                sounding noise can be barely heard as it gets louder and louder and eventually the track eventually explodes into a loud
                breakdown. This quality and quiet portion of the track adds a sense of suspense and anxiety which is satisfied by the
                explosive breakdown.

                Again, near the beginning of the track, ADSR works to evoke different emotions for the same exact sound. There is an
                almost eerie and grainy bitcrushed sound near the beginning of the track. As can be seen by the waveform, the sustain is
                very low, creating a sharp sound which evokes an eerie and unsettling feeling.
                <br>
                <br>
                As the sound progresses, the amplitude increases but more interestingly the attack along with the sustain is extended.
                Accompanied with a higher clarity in the tone of the sound, a more epic and decisive soundscape is created.

                Throughout her discography, Jane expresses her transgender identity and experiences growing up in a digital age, where the online and real-world

            <p>
                The history and construction of the hyperpop genre and its associated communities are without a doubt connected to queer
                culture. The artists of the resulting digitally manufactured subcultures utilize the genre to express queer experiences
                and identities, which can be seen in the more mainstream PC Music artists such as SOPHIE all the way to the youthful
                Soundcloud scene in artists such as Jane Remover. Because of the expansiveness of the hyperpop genre, many other
                subcultures can be looked at to further realize the effects of this unique digital culture.
