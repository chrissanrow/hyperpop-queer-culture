    <p>
        “The Alien Resonances and Queer Obscurities of Hyperpop’s 100 Gecs” argues that the hyperpop genre as a whole acts a
        medium for the expression of human identities beyond the cisnormative standards and that the hyperpop act 100 Gecs in
        particular achieves this queer-forward identity ideology through their sonic and visual compositions. To illustrate this
        idea, the author explores the group’s breakout album 1000 Gecs, analyzing the works’ aesthetic, lyrical, and sonic
        appeals which produce an otherworldly experience. The work is important because there is such a limited sample of
        literature viewing hyperpop through a queer lens and attributing its alienating and escapist capabilities. In relation
        to my research, this work illustrates the queer and identity-based expressional powers of the hyperpop genre, as shown
        through one of the scene’s most prominent acts.

        “The Mediation of Genre, Identity, and Difference in Contemporary (Popular) Music Streaming.” explores ecosystem created
        by modern music consumption and the role of genres, shaped by algorithmic and curational means, in forming identities
        and cultures. In particular, the work looks at Spotify’s “mediation of genre” through “algorithmic and human processes”
        that produce genres that amplify structures of differentiation in music culture. This work is important because it
        challenges the idea perpetuated by Spotify itself that genre definitions are becoming effectively meaningless, taking
        into consideration algorithmic and human systems that cause these genre’s constructions of identity. This work is
        particularly relevant to my argument because it provides context for the subculture and identities constructed and
        amplified by hyperpop, which is a particularly modern and curated genre.

    <p>
        “Assembling Hyperpop: Genre Formation on Wikipedia.” investigates the well-documented online history of the hyperpop
        genre, specifically as it exists through Wikipedia, and the implications on the genre’s cultural identities and social
        manifestations (both associations and dissociations). The authors research the individual editors of the page as well as
        the histories of edits and analyze the descriptions of hyperpop on the page itself to arrive at these conclusions. The
        article is important because it exposes the ramifications of a genre being formulated in a primarily online space, which
        is particularly characteristic of hyperpop. It has great relevance in contextualizing the genre’s formation, as well as
        corroborating the idea of hyperpop’s online status reflecting its unique cultural properties.

        “Opening Up Virtual Mosh Pits: Music Scenes and In-Game Concerts in Fortnite and Minecraft.” highlights the response to
        a global quarantine from various music scenes such as the hyperpop genre, which tended to manifest in video-game based
        concerts. In particular, the author investigates the social landscapes generated in multiplayer online games such as
        Fortnite and Minecraft and the virtual music scenes that arose through these mediums. The article covers an important
        piece of musical culture during the COVID-19 pandemic, during which social relations continued to prosper through online
        forms. Due to hyperpop’s explosion during this time period and its permeation through online spaces such as video games,
        this work is critical in understanding the causation and implications of such communities.

        “Beyond the Binary: Digital Voices and Transhumanist Expression in Sophie’s Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides.” delves
        into the transgender and queer expressions made through hyperpop icon SOPHIE’s album: Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides.
        The author analyzes the digital processing and production, along with other musical techniques strewn throughout
        selected singles of SOPHIE’s work, which illustrate her depiction of her trans and queer identities. The work serves to
        explore the technical and creative methods used in an openly trans hyperpop artists’ music. With respect to my project,
        SOPHIE’s influence on the hyperpop industry as a whole leads her to be an important figure in representing trans
        identities through the genre.
